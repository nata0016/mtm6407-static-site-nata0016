# Riding Basics

  <h2>The Foundations of Good Riding</h2>
  <p>
    Good riding begins with a balanced, independent seat — a position where the rider moves with the horse instead of resisting the motion. 
    Whether you're doing flatwork, trail riding, or preparing for jumping, the basics remain the same: alignment, softness, and consistency.

  <h2>Rider Position</h2>
  <p>
    A strong position is built around a straight line: ear, shoulder, hip, heel. 
    When these points align, you stay centered, stable, and ready to follow your horse’s movement.

    <h3>Tip — Relaxed Shoulders</h3>
    <p>
      Keep your shoulders low and open. Tension in the upper body travels down the reins and creates discomfort for the horse.

  <h2>Seat, Legs, & Hands</h2>

  <div class="info-card">
    <h3>Seat</h3>
    <p>
      Sit deep without sinking. Your pelvis should follow the horse’s movement quietly, 
      absorbing motion while keeping the rest of your body still.
    </p>

  <div class="info-card">
    <h3>Legs</h3>
    <p>
      Your leg is your foundation. Keep it long, wrapped gently around the horse, 
      using your calf for communication rather than gripping with your knees.

  <div class="info-card">
    <h3>Hands</h3>
    <p>
      Maintain a steady contact by keeping your elbows close to your body. 
      Think of your hands as being connected directly to the horse’s mouth—soft, clear, and consistent.

  <h2>Transitions</h2>
  <p>
    Smooth transitions are the hallmark of a well-trained horse and rider. 
    They require balance, timing, and clear aids — not force.

    <h3>Exercise — Walk to Trot</h3>
    <p>
      Engage your core, keep light leg contact, and lift your energy before asking for the trot.
      Allow the horse to step forward into the transition, not rush.
