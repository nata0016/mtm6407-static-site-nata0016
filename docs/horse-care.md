  <h2>Feeding & Nutrition</h2>
  <p>
    A horse’s digestive system is delicate, requiring small, consistent meals and access to clean water.
    Most horses stay healthy on good-quality hay, minerals, and an appropriate concentrate feed if needed.

    <h3>Tip — Make Changes Slowly</h3>

      If you adjust your horse’s diet, do it gradually over 7–10 days to avoid digestive upset or colic.

  <h2>Grooming Essentials</h2>
  <p>
    Grooming does more than clean your horse — it builds trust and helps you detect issues early.
    You should groom before and after every ride to prevent saddle sores and irritation.

  <h2>Blankets, Boots, & Seasonal Care</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on the weather, your horse may need a turnout blanket, stable sheet, fly mask, or leg protection.
    Always check the horse’s temperature under the blanket — overheating is just as dangerous as being too cold.

    <h3>Winter Tip</h3>
    <p>
      Make sure your horse stays dry before blanketing. Damp coats under blankets can cause chills and skin infections.
