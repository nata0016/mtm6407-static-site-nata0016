# My Equestrian Journey

<section class="page-section">
  <h2>How It Started</h2>
  <p>
    My journey with horses began with curiosity — the elegance of riding, the calmness of the barn, 
    and the connection between rider and horse. Over time, that curiosity grew into passion and routine.

  <h2>Learning Through Practice</h2>
  <p>
    Riding is a lifelong learning process. Each lesson brings something new — 
    a better transition, a softer seat, or a deeper understanding of the horse’s behavior.
