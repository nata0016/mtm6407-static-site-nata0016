    <h2>Why this site?</h2>
    <p>
      This site is a small equestrian hub where I collect what I’m learning:
      from basic riding skills to how to keep a horse comfortable, confident,
      and healthy. It’s both a reference for myself and a way to share the
      experience with others who love horses.

  <h2>How I see riding</h2>
  <div class="info-card">
    <h3>Part partnership, part discipline</h3>
    <p>
      Riding is a constant balance between technique and connection. Good basics
      in position, rhythm, and timing build the trust that makes everything else
      possible – from relaxed walks on the trail to more technical work in the arena.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The rest of the site breaks this down in a simple way: what happens in the arena,
    what happens outside on the trails, and what happens behind the scenes in the stable.
